# Docker Build Duration Survey 
Welcome!  

This survey is investigating what Docker practitioners think about the Docker build duration. Our goal is to explore the knowledge and experiences that will hopefully help many other Docker practitioners as well.  

We invite technical experts engaged in Docker builds practice to complete this survey. Your participation is voluntary and confidential, and is expected to take no more than 10 minutes. If you consent to participate in this survey, continue to the next page by clicking on the button below. Once the survey is over, we will only publish aggregated results. The data you provide will be anonymized and cannot be traced back to your identity. Participation will pose no foreseeable risks.  

If you have additional questions or comments, please feel free to contact <evelyn.wu@foxmail.com> directly.   

Thank you for participating!

## Build Duration
The remaining questions are specific to Docker builds that use cloud-based tools/services (e.g., CI tools and Docker Hub automated builds).  

6. Do you think the Docker build is time-consuming?
- Absolutely Yes 
- Probably Yes 
- Not Sure 
- Probably Not 
- Absolutely Not

7. What is your maximum acceptable duration for a Docker build to take?
- 1 minute 
- 5 minutes 
- 10 minutes 
- 20 minutes 
- 30 minutes 
- 60 minutes 
- Varies by project
- Other:

8. Have you ever worked to reduce your Docker build duration?
- Yes 
- No

9. What reasons do you think might cause Docker builds to take too long? 


10. How does long Docker build duration affect your software development? 


## Prediction Techniques
11. If there is an automated tool that can predict Docker build duration without running builds, do you think it would be useful for Docker-based software development?
- Absolutely Yes 
- Probably Yes 
- Not Sure 
- Probably Not 
- Absolutely Not

12. Why do you think Docker build duration prediction would be useful? 


13. Why do you think Docker build duration prediction would not be useful?
